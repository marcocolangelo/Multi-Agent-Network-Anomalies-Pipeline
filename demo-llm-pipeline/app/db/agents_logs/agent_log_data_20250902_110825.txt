**Summary:**
A medium-severity anomaly has been detected, indicating periodic small connections to the same C2 endpoint. This behavior is characterized by regular connections every 60 seconds to the same destination IP address.

**Severity Assessment:**
The severity of this incident is classified as Medium due to the potential for ongoing activity that may indicate a sophisticated threat actor attempting to establish persistent communication with a Command and Control (C2) endpoint.

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
Based on domain knowledge, it is hypothesized that the root cause of this anomaly is a malicious actor using the system to establish periodic connections to a C2 endpoint. This behavior is consistent with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors to maintain persistence and gather intelligence.

**Incident Details:**

* **Anomaly Data:** The provided data indicates that the anomaly occurred on August 26, 2023, at 18:40:00, with a duration of approximately 45.2 seconds.
* **Related Fields:** The relevant fields that contributed to this anomaly include dst_ip, dst_port, protocol, bytes, packets, and duration.

**Historical Patterns:**
No prior incidents have been recorded for this specific anomaly, but historical patterns suggest that similar anomalies may occur in the future if not addressed.

**Recommended Mitigations:**

1. **Network Segmentation:** Implement network segmentation to isolate systems with high-risk connections to C2 endpoints.
2. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):** Configure IDPS to monitor for suspicious traffic patterns, including periodic small connections to the same dst_ip.
3. **Endpoint Security:** Ensure that all endpoints are up-to-date with the latest security patches and have robust endpoint protection in place.
4. **Monitoring and Logging:** Continuously monitor system logs and network traffic to detect and respond to similar anomalies in a timely manner.

**Next Steps:**
Schedule a follow-up review to assess the effectiveness of these mitigations and consider additional measures to prevent future incidents.

**Recommendation for Further Investigation:**
Consider conducting further analysis on the C2 endpoint to determine its origin, purpose, and potential connections to other malicious actors.
